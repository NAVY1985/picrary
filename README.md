### INTRODUCTION
**Picrary** is a library, a tool that is going to help the programmers with their work. The result of this library is an effect (it can be a hover, mouseover, etc) that acts whenever the cursor of the mouse is over an image. When this happens it is going to appear the alt text that the user decides to type over the image.

### How to Use
```
* The user needs to install the library with:  npm install picrary.

* To add this plugin to your project you need these script tags in your html file:

<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js" integrity="sha256-FgpCb/KJQlLNfOu91ta32o/NMZxltwRo8QtmkMRdAu8="crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

<script src="src/app.js"></script>

<script>$('figure').cardify();</script>

* Type the text you want it to appear in the alt attribute, so when the mouse is over the image it can be replaced by the text you typed.
```
