### INTRODUCTION
**Picrary** is a library, a tool that is going to help the programmers with their work. The result of this library is an effect (it can be a hover, mouseover, etc) that acts whenever the cursor of the mouse is over an image. When this happens it is going to appear the alt text that the user decides to type over the image.
